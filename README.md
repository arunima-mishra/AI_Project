# Project Summary:

Our project focuses on improving brain stroke prediction using data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms. Brain strokes are a critical medical condition, and early prediction is vital for better patient outcomes. Existing approaches face challenges in accuracy and timeliness, necessitating a more robust solution.

# Problem Statement:
Traditional methods for predicting strokes rely on risk factors and symptoms, which may not always be conclusive. The complexity of stroke data further complicates manual analysis, leading to potential delays in diagnosis.

# Objective:
Our goal is to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting stroke likelihood based on medical history, lifestyle factors, and other relevant data. By enabling early intervention, we aim to reduce stroke incidence and severity.

# Motivation:
The urgent need to improve stroke prediction and prevention drives our project. Strokes impose a significant global health burden, necessitating proactive strategies to mitigate their impact.

# Proposed Solution:
We propose leveraging data analysis and machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost to build a predictive model. By capturing complex data relationships, our model aims to enhance stroke risk assessment.

# Scope:
Our project involves data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, and model development. Comprehensive datasets will be analyzed and cleaned, relevant features identified, and machine learning algorithms implemented and fine-tuned to build an accurate predictive model.
